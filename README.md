  different screen sizes.
- **Offline Functionality**: As a PWA, the application can be used even when there is no internet connection, with
  changes syncing seamlessly when the connection is restored.

## Technologies

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **JavaScript**: Used for the application logic and user interaction.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application.
